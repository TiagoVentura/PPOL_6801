## Credits

To build this course, I used materials from Arthur Spirling [Text-as-Data](https://github.com/ArthurSpirling/text-as-data-class-spring2021) Class at NYU, and lab materials from various TA's for his course, Pablo Barbera's [Computational Social Science Seminar](http://pablobarbera.com/POIR613/index.html) at USC, Alex Siegel Text-as-Data course in Colorado, and Sebastian Vallejo's seminar at University of Western Ontario. Their materials and inspiration are spread throughout all the materials of the course. Thanks!
